# Golang / React Fibonacci API

## Goals

- Develop an API server in Go which will take a number as input and return the Fibonacci sequence up to that many digits (0 inclusive).

- Develop a simple React web UI which will call the API and display the results.

## Requirements

- I should be able to run your Go code and navigate to your API server at
  localhost:8080/api/fibonacci/2 and get the first 2 digits in the Fibonacci sequence. If I go to localhost:8080/api/fibonacci/24, I should get the first 24 digits, etc.

- I should be able to launch the web UI by running “npm start”. I should then be able to type in
  my number of digits, hit a submit (or similar) button and see the results from the API service
